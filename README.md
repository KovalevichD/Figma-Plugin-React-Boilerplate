# Figma Plugin React18 Boilerplate

This boilerplate is built on the basis of a template generated by [Figma](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/setup/), but with small extensions:
* React 18 + Webpack
* TypeScript
* CSS or SCSS
* promisified messages between Plugin code and React

## Installation
* Run `yarn` to install dependencies. 

## Usage
* Run `yarn build` to build a production version.
* Run `yarn build:watch` to start watching changes.
* Open `Figma` -> `Plugins` -> `Development` -> `Import plugin from manifest...` and choose `manifest.json` file from this repository.
---
* To change the UI of the plugin, start editing [App.tsx](src/client/components/App.tsx).  
* To interact with the Figma API edit [app.ts](src/app/app.ts).
